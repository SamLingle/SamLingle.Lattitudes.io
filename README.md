# lattitudes.io

## Objective
Use Github Pages to create a visualization dashboard for the geograpical weather visualizations from the [weather_py](https://github.com/SamLingle/weather-py) repository. This page consists of 7 pages total, including:

 - A landing page containing:
    - An explanation of the project.
    - Links to each visualizations page.
  - Four visualization pages, each with:
  - A descriptive title and heading tag.
  - The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  - A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
  - A "Comparisons" page that:
    - Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
    - Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    - The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
  - A "Data" page that:
    - Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    - The table must be a bootstrap table component.
    - The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. You may use a csv-to-html table conversion tool, e.g. ConvertCSV.





You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/SamLingle/SamLingle.Lattitudes.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
